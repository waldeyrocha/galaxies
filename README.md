## Table of Contents
This webpage presents information about the largest galaxies in the cosmos. It showcases six different galaxies, each with its image and a brief description. Using grid layout.

## Usage
To view the grid layout, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The style.css file contains the CSS code responsible for the grid layout and styling.

The webpage is styled with a modern design, making use of various CSS properties. Here are some key style features:

The webpage uses the "Mulish" font for general text and the "Source Serif 4" font for headers.
The base font size is set to 62.5% for easier rem units calculation.
The background color is #121214, providing a dark theme for the page.
The content is centered using CSS Grid to ensure a responsive layout on various devices.
Each galaxy's information is displayed within a "card" element, which has rounded corners and a border.
The images within the cards have a padding of 1.0rem and adjust to 100% width of their container.
The "h1" element for the page title has a color of #02799D and a large font size of 5.8rem.
The descriptions and headers of the cards have appropriate font sizes and line heights for readability.
The cards are organized in a grid layout with three columns, with a gap between them.

## Lessons Learned



CSS Grid Layout: The code showcases the power and flexibility of CSS Grid for creating complex layouts with ease. Understanding and utilizing CSS Grid can significantly simplify the process of designing and implementing responsive layouts.

Grid Areas: Grid areas provide a convenient way to name and reference specific regions of the grid. This allows for easy assignment of elements to specific areas using the grid-area property.

Grid Template Areas: The use of grid-template-areas simplifies the definition of the grid layout by visually representing the grid structure using ASCII art. This makes it easier to visualize the layout and helps maintain the code's readability.

Responsive Design: The usage of relative units (e.g., fr and vh) ensures that the layout remains responsive and adapts to various screen sizes and devices.

Commenting: Properly commenting the CSS code helps others (and yourself in the future) understand the layout and its configurations, making it easier to modify and maintain.

Best Practices: It's essential to use consistent and semantic naming conventions for grid areas and grid items to improve code readability and maintainability.

Experimentation: CSS Grid provides numerous possibilities for creating layouts. The code encourages experimentation and encourages developers to explore various grid configurations to achieve the desired design.

HTML and CSS Separation: Keeping HTML and CSS in separate files (index.html and style.css) adheres to best practices, making it easier to manage and maintain codebases.

Grid Gap: Setting a gap between grid items improves the visual separation and spacing of elements within the grid layout.

Box Sizing: Using box-sizing: border-box ensures that padding and border size are included within the element's total width and height, avoiding unexpected layout issues.
